### Hi, I'm Dennis.

##### I am studying to become a system developer specializing in DevSecOps. My background includes nearly three years of English studies at university, which I left to pursue programming. My experience with technology extends to proficient use of Photoshop, Microsoft Office, and music production software like FL Studio.

##### Currently, I am focusing on learning C#, building on my extensive computer experience to develop new skills in programming.
