### Hi, I'm Dennis.

#### I am studying to become a system developer specializing in DevSecOps. 

#### My background includes nearly three years of English studies at university level, which I left to pursue programming. My experience with technology extends to proficient use of Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Office, and music production software like FL Studio.

#### Currently, I am focusing on becoming adept at C# and its related tools. Recently, however, I have also found a new interest in cyber security which I hope will come in handy in my future projects.
